My AQA NEA project:
Rabbit Health Monitoring Through Movement 
A non-intrusive system through use of cameras to analyse rabbitâ€™s movements. These cameras will be attached to raspberry pis and pass the pictures over to a central server where they will be collected, and the location of the rabbits recorded. This data will be used to produce reports which are used by the user or vet to assess the health of the rabbits.
